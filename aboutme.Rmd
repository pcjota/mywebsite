Hi, I’m @pcjota

I have always loved analyzing things, like looking closely at large amounts of data, finding complex patterns in designs, and thinking critically about ideas.
This love has pushed me to try many different fields and get really good at many different skills. Here, you can see a collection of my work that shows my love for analysis and creativity.
Each project is more than just a task — it's a journey of exploration and understanding.
I invite you to browse through my webpage, where you can see the combination of analysis and creativity that is my work.
